Day 4: Randomisation and Python Lists
# modules, common python modules in askpython.com, data structures, lists

# modules in python
# modules = files with the ".py" extension containing python code that can be imported inside another python program

# random module
# implement a random number python module into your code
import random
random_integer = random.randint(1, 10)
print(random_integer)
# write a virtual coin toss program that will randomly tell the user "heads" or "tails"
import random
random_side = random.randint(0, 1)
if random_side == 1:
    print("Heads")
else:
    print("Tails")

# lists in python
# lists = a data structure in python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements
# lists always start with an open square bracket [ and a closing square bracket ]
fruits = ["cherry", "apple", "pear'"]
# extract data out of an index list (starting from the beginning of list)
print(fruits[1])
# extract data out of an index list (starting from the end of list)
print(fruits[-2])
# alter a data item within a data list index
fruits[1] = lemon
print(fruits)
# add an item to the end of a data index list
fruits.append("watermelon")
print(fruits)

# append function in python
# append function = used to add an item to the end of a data list index
# add an item to the end of a data list index
fruits = ["cherry", "apple", "pear'"]
fruits.append("watermelon")
print(fruits)

# extend function in python
# extend function = used to add a list or multiple items to the end of a data list index
# add a list to the end of a data list index
fruits = ["cherry", "apple", "pear'"]
fruits.axtend(["watermelon", "orange", blackberry"])
print(fruits)

# split method in python
# split = allows you to split a string into separate components based on some sort of divider
# directly convert into a list by separating out the commas using str.split(',)
str_inp = "Hello,from,Python"
op = str_inp.split(",")
print(op)

# random bill pay project
# write a program that will select a random name from a list of names where the person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill
import random
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
names = names_string.split(", ")
num_items = len(names)
random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1)
person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice]
print(person_who_will_pay + " is going to buy the meal today!")
# write a simplified program using the choice function that will select a random name from a list of names where the person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill
import random
person_who_will_pay = random.choice(names)
print(person_who_will_pay + " is going to buy the meal today!")

# nested lists in python
# nested lists = a list within a list (used to categorize)
# dirty dozen list = strawberries, spinach, kale, nectarines, apples, grapes, peaches, cherries, pears, tomatoes, celery, potatoes
fruits = ["strawberries", "nectarines", "apples", "grapes", "peaches", "cherries", "pears"]
vegetables = ["spinach", "kale", "tomatoes", "celery", "potatoes"]

# treasure map project
# write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X using a two-digit system
# the first digit is the vertical location and the second digit is the horizontal location
