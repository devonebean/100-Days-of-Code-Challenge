Day 2: Understanding Primitive Data Types and How To Manipulate Strings
# data types, numbers, operations, type conversion, f-strings

# strings in python
# string = sequence of unicode text orcharacters
"Hello"

# subscripting in python
# subscripting = used to access the elements of a string
# subscript operator is defined as square brackets []
# write a program that only ouputs the H in Hello
print("Hello"[0])
# programmers always start counting at 0

# integers in python
# integer = whole number
# 211 or 356_467_067
# underscores _ replace commas , in python integers

# floats in python
# float = floating point number or decimal
3.14159

# booleans in python
# boolean = used to represent the truth value of an expression
# True or False
# a == a (True)
# a != b (True)
# a == b (False)

# type function in python
# type() used for data type checking in python
# use type function to determine data type of two_digit_number:
# two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")
print( type( two_digit_number) )
# answer output: <class 'str'>

# type conversion in python
# data types in python must be converted to same data types before concatenating
# write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
# two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")
first_digit = two_digit_number[0]
second_digit = two_digit_number[1]
result = int(first_digit) + int(second_digit)
print(result)

# mathematical operations in python
# add +
print(14 + 34)
# subtract -
print(6 - 5)
# multiply *
print(4 * 9)
# divide /
print(6 / 3)
#exponent ** 
print(2 ** 2)
# PEMDAS(LR)
print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)
# utilize () to prioritize a calculation
print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3)

# BMI calculator projet
# write a program that calculates the body mass index (BMI) from a user's weight and height
# the BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height
# e.g. if a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight
# the BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m): BMI = weight(kg) / height(m) ** 2
# height = input("enter your height in m: ")
# weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
BMI = int(weight) / float(height) ** 2
print(BMI)
