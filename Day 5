Day 5: Python Loops
# for loops, range, code blocks

# for loop with python lists
# for loop = does something to each item in a list
# for item in list_of_items:
fruits = ["apple", "peach", "pear"]
for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)
  print(fruit + "pie")
print(fruits)

# average height project
# write a program that calculates the average student height from a list of heights using for loops
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
total_height = 0
for height in student_heights:
  total_height += height
print(f"total height = {total_height}")
number_of_students = 0
for student in student_heights:
  number_of_students += 1
print(f"number of students = {number_of_students}")  
average_height = round(total_height / number_of_students)
print(f"average height of students = {average_height})

# highest score project
# write a program that calculates the highest score from a list of scores
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)
highest_score = 0
for score in student_scores:
  if score > highest_score:
    highest_score = score
print(f"The highest score in the class is: {highest_score}")
