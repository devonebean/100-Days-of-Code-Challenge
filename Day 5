Day 5: Python Loops
# for loops, range, code blocks

# for loop with python lists
# for loop = does something to each item in a list
# for item in list_of_items:
fruits = ["apple", "peach", "pear"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + "pie")
print(fruits)

# average height project
# write a program that calculates the average student height from a list of heights using for loops
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
    student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
total_height = 0
for height in student_heights:
    total_height += height
print(f"total height = {total_height}")
number_of_students = 0
for student in student_heights:
    number_of_students += 1
print(f"number of students = {number_of_students}")  
average_height = round(total_height / number_of_students)
print(f"average height of students = {average_height})

# highest score project
# write a program that calculates the highest score from a list of scores
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
    student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)
highest_score = 0
for score in student_scores:
    if score > highest_score:
        highest_score = score
print(f"The highest score in the class is: {highest_score}")

# range function in python
# range function = generates a range of numbers to loop through
total = 0
for number in range(1, 101):
    total += number
print(total)

# adding evens project
# write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100
total = 0
for number in range(2, 101, 2):
    total += number
print(total)

# fizzbuzz project
# write a program that automatically prints the solution to the fizzbuzz game
# your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn
# when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "fizz"
# when the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "buzz"
# and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "fizzbuzz"
for number in range(1, 101):
for number in range(1, 101):
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif number % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(number)
    
# shuffle function in python
# shuffle = reorders the the items in a sepuence or list
random.shuffle(password_list)

# password generator project
# write a program that will generate a random password
