Day 3: Control Flow and Logical Operators
# conditional statements, logical operators, code blocks, scope

# conditional statements in python
# conditional statements are defined as if / else 
# use conditional statements to control flow
# write a program to replace a ticket box
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int( input("What is your height in cm?") )
if height >= 120:
  print("You can ride the rollercoaster!")
  age = int( input( "What is your age?") )
  if age < 10:
    print("Sorry, you have to be at least 10 years old to ride.")
  if age < 12:
    print("Please pay $5.")
  elif age <= 18:
    print("Please pay $7.")
  else:
    print("Please pay $12.")
else:
  print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
# lines below if / else statements are indented

# comparison operators
# > grater than
# < less than
# >= greater than or equal to
# <= less than or equal to
# == equal to
# != not equal to

# modulo in python
# the modulo is written as a percentage sign % in python
# modulo gives you the remainder after a division e.g.:
# 6 รท 2 = 3 with no remainder, therefore: 6 % 2 = 0
# 5 รท 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1, therefore: 5 % 2 = 1
# 14 รท 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2, therefore: 14 % 4 = 2

# odd or even project
# write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number
number = int( input("Which number do you want to check? ") )
if number % 2 == 0:
  print("This is an even number.")
else:
  print("This is an odd number")
