Day 3: Control Flow and Logical Operators
# conditional statements, logical operators, code blocks, scope

# conditional statements in python
# conditional statements are defined as if / else 
# use conditional statements to control flow
# write a program to replace a ticket box
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int( input("What is your height in cm?") )
if height >= 120:
  print("You can ride the rollercoaster!")
  age = int( input( "What is your age?") )
  if age < 10:
    print("Sorry, you have to be at least 10 years old to ride.")
  if age < 12:
    print("Please pay $5.")
  elif age <= 18:
    print("Please pay $7.")
  else:
    print("Please pay $12.")
else:
  print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
# lines below if / else statements are indented

# comparison operators
# > grater than
# < less than
# >= greater than or equal to
# <= less than or equal to
# == equal to
# != not equal to

# modulo in python
# the modulo is written as a percentage sign % in python
# modulo gives you the remainder after a division e.g.:
# 6 ÷ 2 = 3 with no remainder, therefore: 6 % 2 = 0
# 5 ÷ 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1, therefore: 5 % 2 = 1
# 14 ÷ 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2, therefore: 14 % 4 = 2

# odd or even project
# write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number
number = int( input("Which number do you want to check? ") )
if number % 2 == 0:
  print("This is an even number.")
else:
  print("This is an odd number")

# bmi calculator 2.0 project
# write a program that interprets the body mass index (bmi) based on a user's weight and height
# it should tell them the interpretation of their bmi based on the bmi value
# under 18.5 they are underweight
# over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# above 35 they are clinically obese
height = float( input("Enter your height in m: ") )
weight = float( input("Enter your weight in kg: ") )
bmi = round(weight / height ** 2)
if bmi < 18.5:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")
elif bmi < 25:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight.")
elif bmi < 30:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif bmi < 35:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese.")
else:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinically obese.")

# leap year project
# write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year
# determine whether if a particular year is a leap year
# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
# **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
# **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400
# e.g. The year 2000:
# 2000 ÷ 4 = 500 (Leap)
# 2000 ÷ 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
# 2000 ÷ 400 = 5 (Leap!)
# so the year 2000 is a leap year
# but the year 2100 is not a leap year because:
# 2100 ÷ 4 = 525 (Leap)
# 2100 ÷ 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
# 2100 ÷ 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)
year = int( input("Which year do you want to check? ") )
if year % 4 == 0:
  if year % 100 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
      print("Leap year.")
    else:
      peint("Not leap year.")
  else:
    print("Leap year.")
else:
  print("Not leap year.")
