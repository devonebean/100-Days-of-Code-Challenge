Day 3: Control Flow and Logical Operators
# conditional statements, logical operators, code blocks, scope

# conditional statements in python
# conditional statements are defined as if / else 
# use conditional statements to control flow
# write a program to replace a ticket box

# lines below if / else statements are indented

# comparison operators
# > grater than
# < less than
# >= greater than or equal to
# <= less than or equal to
# == equal to
# != not equal to

# modulo in python
# the modulo is written as a percentage sign % in python
# modulo = gives you the remainder after a division e.g.:
# 6 ÷ 2 = 3 with no remainder, therefore: 6 % 2 = 0
# 5 ÷ 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1, therefore: 5 % 2 = 1
# 14 ÷ 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2, therefore: 14 % 4 = 2

# odd or even project

# bmi calculator 2.0 project
# write a program that interprets the body mass index (bmi) based on a user's weight and height
# it should tell them the interpretation of their bmi based on the bmi value
# under 18.5 they are underweight
# over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# above 35 they are clinically obese

# leap year project
# write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year
# determine whether if a particular year is a leap year
# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
# **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
# **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400
# e.g. The year 2000:
# 2000 ÷ 4 = 500 (Leap)
# 2000 ÷ 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
# 2000 ÷ 400 = 5 (Leap!)
# so the year 2000 is a leap year
# but the year 2100 is not a leap year because:
# 2100 ÷ 4 = 525 (Leap)
# 2100 ÷ 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
# 2100 ÷ 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

# love calculator project
# write a program that tests the compatibility between two people
# to work out the love score between two people:
# take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs
# then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs
# then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number
# for love scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# for Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
# "Your score is **z**."
# e.g.
# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# T occurs 0 times
# R occurs 1 time
# U occurs 2 times
# E occurs 2 times
# total = 5
# L occurs 1 time
