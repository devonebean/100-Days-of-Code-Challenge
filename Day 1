Day 1: Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data
# printing, commenting, debugging, string manipulation, variables

# print function in python
# print function = prints the specified message to the console output
# printing to console in python
print("Hello world!")
# write a program that prints:
# Day 1 - Python Print Function
# The function is declared like this:
# print('what to print')
print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print( "print('what to print')" )

# string manipulation and code intelligence
# string concatenation is done with the + sign
# e.g. print("Hello " + "world!")
# new lines can be created with a backslash and n
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world!")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# debugging code
# fix the code so that it runs without errors:
# print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
#  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# input function in python
# input() = get user input in console
input("What is your name?")
# then print() will print "string text" and the user input
print("Hello " + input("What is your name? "))

# lenth function in python
# len() = get the length of the given string
# write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name
print( len( input("What is your name?") ) )

# variable naming
name = "Jack"
print(name)
name = "Angela"
print(name)
name = input("What is your name? ")
length = len(name)
print(length)

# variable values
# write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b:
a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")
c = a
a = b
b = c
print("a: " + a)
print("b: " + b)

# band name generator project
# create a greeting for your program
print("Welcome to the band name generator!")
# ask the user for the city that they grew up in
# input() will get user input in console
# \n = new line
city = input("Which city did you grow up in?\n")
# ask the user for the name of a pet
pet = input("What is the name of a pet?\n")
# input() will get user input in console
# then print() will print "string text" and the user input
# combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
# make sure the input cursor shows on a new line
